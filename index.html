                <h2>The equation changed.</h2>
                <p>Your landlord has a legal team. Your insurance company has an algorithm. Your ISP has a call center designed to outlast your frustration.</p>
                <p>Money has been used as a tool to keep people in line. Can't afford a lawyer. Can't afford a consultant. Can't afford to fight.</p>
                <p>AI breaks that equation. The cost of understanding your own situation just dropped to zero.</p>
                <p>This is not about AI replacing people. It's about AI returning power to people who never had it.</p>

                    <h3>The Tech Who Thought It Was Magic</h3>
                    <p>My ISP sent a technician for the sixth time. He looked at my screen and saw real-time dashboards tracking packet loss, jitter, bufferbloat — tools that dig deep into traffic stability and show exactly whether I'm getting what I pay for. He thought it was some kind of professional setup. It wasn't. It was me and Claude, building programs the way a developer would — except I'm not a developer. AI didn't just give me answers. It gave me tools.</p>

                    <h3>The ISP That Bet I'd Give Up</h3>
                    <p>259 speed tests. 34.7% packet loss. 2 years of broken service. 5 tech visits that fixed nothing. Then AI turned frustration into an FCC complaint with data they couldn't ignore.</p>

                <p>Not "10 prompts to boost productivity." Not hype.</p>
                <p>Just a regular person using AI to stop getting pushed around.</p>
