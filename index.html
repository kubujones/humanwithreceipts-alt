                <h2>The equation changed.</h2>
                <p>Your landlord has a legal team. Your insurance company has an algorithm. Your ISP has a call center designed to outlast your frustration.</p>
                <p>Money has been used as a tool to keep people in line. Can't afford a lawyer. Can't afford a consultant. Can't afford to fight.</p>
                <p>AI breaks that equation. The cost of understanding your own situation just dropped to zero.</p>
                <p>This is not about AI replacing people. It's about AI returning power to people who never had it.</p>

                    <p>259 speed tests. 34.7% packet loss. 2 years of broken service. 5 tech visits that fixed nothing. Then AI turned frustration into an FCC complaint with data they couldn't ignore.</p>
